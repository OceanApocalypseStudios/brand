TrenchRaw 2025 — Static Site Package
====================================

This package includes a ready-to-deploy static site for:
  trenchraw2025.oceanapocalypsestudios.org

Contents:
 - index.html           (main site)
 - styles.css           (site styles)
 - logo.svg             (main SVG logo)
 - trenchraw_site.zip   (this archive)

How to deploy (simple):
  1. Host on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) or upload to your server.
  2. If using your server: copy files to the web root (e.g., /var/www/trenchraw2025).
  3. Configure DNS: create A or CNAME records for trenchraw2025.oceanapocalypsestudios.org pointing to your host.
  4. Ensure HTTPS: enable TLS (Let's Encrypt or your provider).
  5. (Optional) Replace placeholder PDF and links with your real assets.

Notes:
 - The site uses Google Fonts for Inter and Material Symbols. Ensure outbound access for fonts or self-host the fonts for offline usage.
 - The palette and typography in the site reflect the official TrenchRaw Brand Guidelines. The brand palette is the canonical palette, but apps are allowed to use additional functional colors as needed.
 - This package is a design-forward starting point. Tweak copy, accessibility, and translations as needed.

Enjoy — and congrats, it's ready to go live.
