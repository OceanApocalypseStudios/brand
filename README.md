# Logo
Every graphic file with minimum resolution 512x512 and visually represents a repository or a project/program, is to be considered a logo. It must **not** be in `.ico` format.

# Icon
Every graphic file with minimum resolution 16x16 and recommended maximum resolution 512x512 and is similar to the logo, while representing it with the size limitations, is to be considered an icon. It must **not** be in `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp` or derivates.

Icons can be used by executable files and may contain several resolutions in the same file.
